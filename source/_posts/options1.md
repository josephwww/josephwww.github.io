# Introduction

Recently, I started exploring **US stock options** to expand my financial knowledge and trading strategies. As someone who has been learning about finance and trading strategies, diving into the options market was both exciting and challenging.

In this post, I’ll share my first impressions, key concepts I’ve learned, and the resources that helped me get started.

## What Are Stock Options?

Stock options are financial derivatives that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a specified price before a certain date. There are two main types of options:

1. **Call Options**: These give the holder the right to buy a stock at a specific price.
2. **Put Options**: These give the holder the right to sell a stock at a specific price.

The price at which the stock can be bought or sold is known as the **strike price**, and the date by which the option must be exercised is the **expiration date**.

## Key Concepts I Learned

### 1. Option Premium
The option premium is the price you pay to purchase an option. It is influenced by several factors, including:
- **Intrinsic Value**: The difference between the current stock price and the strike price.
- **Time Value**: The remaining time until the option’s expiration. The more time left, the higher the premium.
- **Implied Volatility**: How much the market expects the stock price to move.

### 2. The Greeks
Options pricing is affected by several variables known as the **Greeks**:
- **Delta**: Measures how much the option price changes with a $1 change in the stock price.
- **Gamma**: Measures the rate of change of Delta.
- **Theta**: Represents time decay, or how much the option’s price decreases as expiration approaches.
- **Vega**: Measures sensitivity to changes in implied volatility.

### 3. Risk Management
Since options can be highly leveraged, risk management is crucial. I learned to:
- Only trade with money I can afford to lose.
- Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.
- Diversify my trades to avoid over-concentration.

## My First Trade

For my first trade, I chose a **call option** on a well-known tech stock. My decision was based on:
- Positive earnings reports and upcoming product launches.
- A bullish trend in the overall market.

Although the trade didn’t result in huge profits, it gave me valuable hands-on experience in placing orders, tracking option premiums, and managing emotions during market fluctuations.
